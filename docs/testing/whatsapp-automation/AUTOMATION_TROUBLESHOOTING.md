# üîß WhatsApp Automation Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Dashboard Working but Auto-Responses Not Sending

You're experiencing this because the current system is designed for **WhatsApp Business API** (which requires Meta verification), but you're testing with **WhatsApp Business app** on your phone.

## üéØ **Quick Fix: Test the Automation Logic**

### **Step 1: Test Auto-Response Logic in Dashboard**

1. **Go to your dashboard**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
2. **Navigate to a configured business**
3. **Look for "Test Automation" button** (should test the response logic)
4. **Check if auto-response rules are working correctly**

### **Step 2: Manual Testing Process**

Since WhatsApp Business API isn't connected yet, let's test the automation **logic** manually:

#### **Test Your Auto-Response Rules:**
```
Test Message: "Hi"
Expected Response Rule: Welcome message
Your Business Response: "[Check what your dashboard shows]"

Test Message: "menu" 
Expected Response Rule: Menu information
Your Business Response: "[Check what your dashboard shows]"

Test Message: "hours"
Expected Response Rule: Business hours
Your Business Response: "[Check what your dashboard shows]"
```

## üîç **Why Auto-Responses Aren't Working**

### **The Real Issue:**
Your dashboard is **simulating** the automation, but it's not connected to actual WhatsApp because:

1. **WhatsApp Business API requires**:
   - Meta Developer account
   - Business verification
   - Webhook setup
   - API access tokens

2. **You're testing with**:
   - WhatsApp Business app on phone
   - Local dashboard simulation
   - No API connection
