   - Configuration loading performance: < 10ms average, < 50ms P95
   - API failure scenarios: timeout, rate limit, service unavailable, network failure
   - Concurrent load testing: 50+ simultaneous requests with < 2 second response time
   - Business logic validation across multiple scenarios

### ✅ Implementation Order and Dependencies Finalization
**Objective**: Finalize implementation order and dependencies

**Deliverables Created**:
1. **Implementation Dependency Graph**
   - Visual Mermaid diagram showing complete dependency relationships
   - Configuration System → Budget/Industry/Channel engines → Goal Parser/Campaign Generator
   - API Gateway parallel integration with all dynamic engines
   - Testing Framework integration points

2. **Phase-by-Phase Implementation Order**
   - **Phase 1** (Day 2): Foundation - Budget Thresholds + Industry Multipliers (8 hours)
   - **Phase 2** (Day 3): Performance Data - Channel Baselines + Blending (8 hours)  
   - **Phase 3** (Day 4): Audience Intelligence - Affinity + Regional Factors (8 hours)
   - **Phase 4** (Day 5): Validation - E2E Testing + Optimization (8 hours)

3. **Risk-Mitigated Sequencing**
   - Critical business impact items first (Budget Thresholds)
   - High dependency items early (Industry Multipliers before Campaign Generator integration)
   - Performance-sensitive items with dedicated optimization phase
   - Validation and rollback preparation before production deployment
