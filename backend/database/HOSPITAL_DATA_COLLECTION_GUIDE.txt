DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Initial Meeting: Present this checklist and explain confidentiality
2. Phased Collection: Don't ask for everything at once
3. Multiple Sources: Cross-verify data from different departments
4. Documentation: Get official documents where possible
5. Validation: Ask clarifying questions for unusual data points

DATA SOURCES WITHIN HOSPITAL:
- Administration/CEO office
- Finance Department
- Medical Records Department
- Quality Department
- IT Department
- Human Resources
- Marketing Department

CONFIDENTIALITY ASSURANCE:
□ Signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
□ Data security protocols in place
□ Limited access to sensitive information
□ Anonymization for benchmarking purposes
□ Clear data usage and retention policies

================================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before using any data for analysis:
□ Cross-check financial figures with multiple sources
□ Verify operational metrics with department heads
□ Validate patient volumes with registration data
□ Confirm quality metrics with quality department
□ Check accreditation status with official certificates
□ Verify staffing numbers with HR department
□ Validate technology systems with IT department

RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:
- Numbers that seem too good or too bad to be true
- Inconsistencies between different data sources
- Reluctance to provide basic operational data
- Outdated information being passed as current
- Rounded numbers that suggest estimates rather than actuals

================================================================================
POST-COLLECTION ACTIVITIES
================================================================================

1. DATA PROCESSING (Week 8)
□ Clean and standardize all collected data
□ Identify missing information gaps
□ Calculate derived metrics and ratios
□ Validate data consistency and accuracy
□ Create hospital profile summary

2. INITIAL ANALYSIS (Week 9)
□ Compare against industry standards
□ Identify performance strengths and weaknesses
□ Generate preliminary benchmarking report
□ Prepare initial recommendations (conservative)

3. FEEDBACK SESSION (Week 10)
□ Present findings to hospital leadership
□ Validate analysis accuracy with their experience
□ Refine recommendations based on feedback
□ Plan implementation priorities

Subject: Partnership for Hospital Performance Analytics - Data Requirements

Dear [Hospital Administrator/CEO Name],

Thank you for partnering with us for the VERTICAL LIGHT OS pilot program. To provide you with the most accurate and valuable benchmarking analysis, we need to collect some operational and performance data.

We've structured this data collection in phases to minimize disruption to your operations:

Phase 1 (Week 1): Basic hospital profile and infrastructure data
Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Operational metrics and staffing information  
Phase 3 (Week 3-4): Financial performance data (confidential)
Phase 4 (Week 4-5): Quality metrics and patient satisfaction
Phase 5 (Week 5-6): Technology systems and IT infrastructure
Phase 6 (Week 6-7): Market positioning and competitive analysis

All data will be:
- Kept strictly confidential under our signed NDA
- Used solely for your benchmarking analysis
- Anonymized for any comparative studies
- Stored securely with limited access

We can work with your team's schedule and provide data collection templates for each phase. Our goal is to create a comprehensive analysis that helps you identify specific improvement opportunities and competitive advantages.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS
================================================================================

1. START SMALL: Don't overwhelm them with all requests at once
2. BUILD TRUST: Prove value with basic analysis before asking for sensitive data
3. BE FLEXIBLE: Adapt timeline based on their availability
4. SHOW VALUE: Provide interim insights as you collect data
5. MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY: Never share specific data with other hospitals
6. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING: Keep detailed notes of all interactions
7. VALIDATE CONTINUOUSLY: Cross-check data throughout the process
8. FOCUS ON ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS: Ensure your analysis leads to practical recommendations

SUCCESS METRIC: 
If they're willing to provide 70% of Phase 1-3 data, you can generate meaningful analysis.
If they provide 90% of all phases, you can create comprehensive benchmarking.
