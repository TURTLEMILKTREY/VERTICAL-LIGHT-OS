PRODUCTION READINESS ASSESSMENT
==============================

Comprehensive evaluation of current system's production readiness
for real-world deployment in healthcare consulting environments.

This assessment covers all critical production deployment factors:
- Security posture
- Scalability architecture  
- Error handling and resilience
- Performance and monitoring
- Data management
- Compliance requirements
- Operational readiness
