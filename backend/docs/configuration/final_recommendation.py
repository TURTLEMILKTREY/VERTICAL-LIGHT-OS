# PROS AND CONS OF THE HYBRID APPROACH
# ====================================

PROS_OF_HYBRID_APPROACH = {
    "User Control": [
        "✅ Users control ALL business logic through config files",
        "✅ No hardcoded business assumptions anywhere in code", 
        "✅ Runtime configuration changes supported",
        "✅ Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)",
        "✅ User-specific overrides for personal preferences"
    ],
    
    "Developer Experience": [
        "✅ Clear separation of code logic vs business rules",

        "✅ Type safety and range validation"
    ],
    
    "Testing Quality": [
        "✅ Tests work with ANY valid configuration values",

    "Development Speed": [
        "❌ Slower initial development (more architecture upfront)",
        "❌ Property-based tests may find edge cases requiring fixes",
        "❌ Configuration schema evolution requires migration planning",
        "❌ More thorough testing required due to increased flexibility"
    ],
    
    "Runtime Dependencies": [
        "❌ File I/O for configuration loading",

# WHAT I SPECIFICALLY RECOMMEND FOR YOU
# =====================================

MY_GUIDANCE = """
DECISION: I strongly recommend implementing the Layered Hybrid Approach.

WHY THIS SOLVES YOUR PROBLEMS:
1. ✅ Eliminates hardcoded business assumptions (your main concern)
2. ✅ Gives users complete control over business logic
3. ✅ Provides comprehensive testing without embedded assumptions
4. ✅ Scales from simple to enterprise usage
5. ✅ Maintains reliability without sacrificing flexibility

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
Start with Phase 1 (External Configuration) - this gives you immediate benefit
and solves 80% of the problem you identified. The other layers add robustness
but aren't required for basic functionality.

RISK MITIGATION:
- Start with one microservice (competitive analysis) as proof of concept
- Keep existing tests running in parallel during migration
- Implement gradual rollout with fallback to current system
- Add comprehensive monitoring for configuration-related issues

LONG-TERM BENEFITS:
- Your system becomes truly industry-agnostic
- Users can adapt it to any business model or market
- Testing becomes more reliable and comprehensive  
- Maintenance becomes easier with clear separation of concerns
- Scaling to new markets/industries becomes trivial

HONEST ASSESSMENT:
This is more work upfront, but it's the RIGHT architecture for a system
that needs to work across different industries and business models.
The alternative is continuing to embed business assumptions in code,
which limits your system's applicability and user control.
